<h2> About </h2>
This project was inspired by all i learnt from Holberton pragram in software engineering.<br> <br/>
This is a youtube downloader which can be used to download videos on youtube and save them anywhere you choose to in your local machine.<br> <br/>
A route in the YouTube API that might be very useful is /get_video_info?video_id=${videoId}&eurl={eurl}. <br><br/>
This route sends back data about the video, which includes the videoId, title, length in seconds, <br> <br/>
links from where the video can be streamed in different qualities and the likes.
<br> <br/>
<br> <br/>
This helps you avoid the stress of looking for another website or application to get your video to your computer or phone.
<br> <br/>
It also saves you from having to expose your data on other websites â€“ all in the qoest of getting a video from YouTube to your local storage.
